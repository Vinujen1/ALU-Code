This project defines a digital processing system using VHDL. The ALU files handle arithmetic and logic operations. ClockSignal and clock_div manage timing. FSM controls operation flow, decoder directs signals, and latch1 stores data. Machine integrates all parts, while sseg and ssegp3 control a seven-segment display to show outputs.
